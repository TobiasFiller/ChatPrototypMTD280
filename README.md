# ChatPrototypMTD280
a small chat application made with vue.js and node.js

In order to use this prototype, you have to have node.js installed!
then just open your console in the right directory and start the iochatserver.js
now the server is running, and you can open the index.html in ioChatClient
type in a name and join the server.

you can join the server multiple times if you just open up the index.html in another window :)
